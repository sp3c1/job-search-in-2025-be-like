# Jelly Back-end Tech Test

Thank you for taking the time to interview at Jelly!

*Please read this whole document before beginning any work.*

⏰ Please note that this challenge is designed to be completed in a relatively short amount of time. Focus on producing a functional solution, and feel free to note areas where you would improve or expand upon your implementation.

🤖 We want to test you, not your AI, so please **write your own code without AI assistance**. (However, you may make notes on where you think AI would have helped.)

⁉️ The problem statement is intentionally vague — please document any assumptions you make along the way.

🗣️ The next stage of this interview will be to review your work and have an open conversation about the technologies involved and the decisions you made. **Please ensure that you have the tech test up and running on your computer for the follow-up interview.**

Good luck and have fun!

## Overview

The `/data` folder in the repository contains a data dump with various ingredients and their prices over time.

The `/backend` folder is where you should build your API.

## Requirements & Guidelines

💽 You have been provided with multiple files in `/data` which give you various ingredients and their prices over time.

🕸️ You are to create an application that allows you to create new recipes and view existing recipes, with their current cost to produce clearly displayed.

📈 You must build a GraphQL/TypeScript API that interfaces with a **relational database** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.) to manage the recipe and ingredient data.

📦 Feel free to use any packages you deem necessary, but remember that we need to see what *you* are capable of, not just how well you can integrate existing libraries.

## Submission

1. **Commit your code** to a **private GitHub repo**.
2. **Add** `dobre-robert-marius` and `JackPriceBurns` so we can access your work.
3. **Send an email** letting us know you’re done and ready for review.
