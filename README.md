# Mission. 

2025 became a harrowing jobseeking experience. And as you spent countless hours on calls, writting "tech tests" life goes by. 
So I decided to document all the "test" that I have been commiting so far. Maybe you find it and decide to do it better. 
Maybe it will help you to do it differently and get the job. It is body of **my work** that no one paid me for, so feel free to do what you want with it. In the least its a way for me to look back at the code. Index by date `ASC`. ☮️
